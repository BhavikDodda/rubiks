# Order of a Rubik's Cube permutation on a 3x3

To find the number of times a rubik's cube algorithm should be done to get back to the initial configuration.

[rubik perm order.py](https://github.com/BhavikDodda/rubiks/blob/main/rubik%20perm%20order.py) helps calculate the order of a permutations using group theory by viewing it as a bijective function and finding the number of times it must be composed with itself to get the identity function element.
